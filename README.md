## Recommendations
It is recommended that Windows users first [install Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

If you do not already have a preferred text editor that you use for programming, it is recommended that you [install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  

In addition, you may find the following VS Code plugins useful:
* [solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity)
